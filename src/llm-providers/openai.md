# OpenAI Provider

Configure the OpenAI provider by setting:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` – required
- `OPENAI_MODEL` – optional (defaults to `gpt-5-mini`)

Once the key is available in the environment, `ai-wright` will automatically pick the OpenAI provider when it is the highest priority authenticated option.
